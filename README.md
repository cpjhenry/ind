ind
===

'ind' is a bash script which calculates the Byzantine year, indiction for
current and Byzantine year, the Buddhist year, and the year from the
founding of the City of Rome. Other available lunar-solar calculations
include: metonic cycle, epact, dominical year, Rosh Hashanah and the Hebrew
calendar, and Buddhist holidays in the Theravadan tradition.

## Installation
- Copy script to your local 'bin' directory, or somewhere in path.
- Copy man file to your local 'share/man' directory or somewhere in manpath.

## History
This project was inspired by Harry Turtledove's _Agent of Byzantium_. As an
aficionado of horology, I went looking for a tool which would easily
calculate the Byzantine (and common era) indictions. Finding none, I created
my own.

## A brief history of dating systems
The Hebrew or Jewish calendar: is a lunisolar calendar used today
predominantly for Jewish religious observances. The principles and rules
were fully codified by Maimonides whose work also replaced counting "years
since the destruction of the Temple" with the modern creation-era Anno
Mundi. The Hebrew lunar year is about eleven days shorter than the solar
cycle and uses the 19-year Metonic cycle to bring it into line, with the
addition of an intercalary month every two or three years.

"Ab urbe condita" (also "anno urbis", a.u.), or "from the founding of the
City (Rome)", traditionally dated to 753 BC. AUC is a year-numbering system
used by historians of ancient Rome to identify particular years. The
dominant method of identifying years in Roman times was to name the two
consuls who held office that year. The regnal year of the emperor was also
used to identify years, especially in the Byzantine Empire after 537.

The Byzantine calendar: also "Creation Era of Constantinople," or "Era of
the World" was the calendar used by the Eastern Orthodox Church from c. 691
to 1728 in the Ecumenical Patriarchate. It was also the official calendar of
the Byzantine Empire from 988 to 1453, and in Russia from c. 988 to 1700.
The calendar is based on the Julian calendar except that the year started on
1 September and the year number used an Anno Mundi epoch. Its year one, from
creation, was September 1, 5509 BC to August 31, 5508 BC.

An indiction: is any of the years in a 15-year cycle used to date medieval
documents throughout Europe, both East and West. Each year of a cycle was
numbered: first indiction, second indiction, etc. However, the cycles were
not numbered, thus other information is needed to identify specific years.

The Buddhist calendar: is a set of lunisolar calendars primarily used in
mainland Southeast Asian countries of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand
as well as in Sri Lanka for religious and/or official occasions. In
Thailand, the name Buddhist Era is a year numbering system shared by the
traditional Thai lunisolar calendar and by the Thai solar calendar.

Epact: If a solar and lunar year start on the same day, then after one year,
the start of the solar year is 11 days after the start of the lunar year.
These excess days are epacts, and are added to the day of the solar year to
determine the day of the lunar year.

### Uposatha
The Uposatha (Sanskrit: Upavasatha) is a Buddhist day of observance, in
existence from the Buddha's time (500 BCE), and still being kept today in
Buddhist countries. The Buddha taught that the Uposatha day is for "the
cleansing of the defiled mind", resulting in inner calm and joy. On this
day, lay disciples and monks intensify their practice, deepen their
knowledge and express communal commitment through millennia-old acts of
lay-monastic reciprocity. On these days, the lay followers make a conscious
effort to keep the Five Precepts or (as the tradition suggests) the Eight
Precepts. It is a day for practising the Buddha's teachings and meditation.

There are five 'special' full moon Uposatha:

- Sangha day (February)
- Buddha day (May)
- Dhamma day (July)
- Pavarana (October)
- Anapanasati day (November)
