ind
===

'ind' is a bash script which calculates the Byzantine year, indiction for
current and Byzantine year, the Buddhist year, and the year from the
founding of the City of Rome. Other available lunar-solar calculations
include: metonic cycle, epact, dominical year, Rosh Hashanah and the Hebrew
calendar, and Buddhist holidays in the Theravadan tradition.

Other obscure and idiosyncratic dating system support, including unusual
holidays, has also been added. Please see the man file for full list.

## Installation
- Copy script to your local 'bin' directory, or somewhere in path.
- Copy 'getusage' to your local 'bin' directory, or somewhwere in path.
- Copy man file to your local 'share/man' directory or somewhere in manpath.

## History
This project was inspired by Harry Turtledove's _Agent of Byzantium_. As an
aficionado of horology, I went looking for a tool which would easily
calculate the Byzantine (and common era) indictions. Finding none, I created
my own.

Like all good programs, 'ind' has expanded beyond both its original scope,
and one might suggest, its usefulness. Take that, _Old Farmer's Almanac_!

Please see ChangeLog for a history of changes to this script.

## Helpers
Installing the following helper apps, will enable additional features:

- 'remind' provides for more sophisticated Hebrew and lunar calculations
- 'ddate' provides Discordian date support
- 'hh' (by the same author) provides Hanke-Henry date support

'ind' is self-documenting. The extraction script -- 'getusage' -- is
included with this distribution.
