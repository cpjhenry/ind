.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBind\fR is a bash script which calculates the Byzantine year, indiction for current and Byzantine year, the Buddhist year, the year from the founding of the City of Rome and the Japanese Imperial year\.
.
.P
Lunar\-solar calculations include: metonic cycle, epact, dominical year, Rosh Hashanah and the Hebrew calendar, and Buddhist holidays in the Theravadan tradition\. Astronomical dating includes current Julian period and Modified Julian Date\.
.
.P
Users of Darwin (Mac) systems should install (and alias) the latest \fBcoreutils\fR using your preferred third\-party package manager\.
.
.P
Lunar holiday calculations require the phases(1) tool to properly calculate lunar dates\.
.
.P
Hebrew holiday calculations require the hebcal(1) tool\.
.
.P
Discordian calculations require the ddate(1) tool\. Likewise, Hanke\-Henry calculations require the use of the hh(1) tool\. If either utility is not present, calculations will be turned off automatically\.

.SS "A brief history of dating systems (source: Wikipedia)"
The Hebrew or Jewish calendar: is a lunisolar calendar used today predominantly for Jewish religious observances\. The principles and rules were fully codified by Maimonides whose work also replaced counting "years since the destruction of the Temple" with the modern creation\-era Anno Mundi\. The Hebrew lunar year is about eleven days shorter than the solar cycle and uses the 19\-year Metonic cycle to bring it into line, with the addition of an intercalary month every two or three years\.
.
.P
The Masoretic calendar (Anno Lucis): is a dating system used in ceremonial or commemorative proceedings, which is equivalent to the Gregorian year plus 4000\. It is similar to Anno Mundi\.
.
.P
"Ab urbe condita" (also "anno urbis", a\.u\.), or "from the founding of the City (Rome)", traditionally dated to 753 BC\. AUC is a year\-numbering system used by historians of ancient Rome to identify particular years\. The dominant method of identifying years in Roman times was to name the two consuls who held office that year\. The regnal year of the emperor was also used to identify years, especially in the Byzantine Empire after 537\.
.
.P
The Byzantine calendar: also "Creation Era of Constantinople," or "Era of the World" (Anno Mundi) was the calendar used by the Eastern Orthodox Church from c\. 691 to 1728 in the Ecumenical Patriarchate\. It was also the official calendar of the Byzantine Empire from 988 to 1453, and in Russia from c\. 988 to 1700\. The calendar is based on the Julian calendar except that the year started on 1 September and the year number used an Anno Mundi epoch\. Its year one, from creation, was September 1, 5509 BC to August 31, 5508 BC\.
.
.P
An indiction: is any of the years in a 15\-year cycle used to date medieval documents throughout Europe, both East and West\. Each year of a cycle was numbered: first indiction, second indiction, etc\. However, the cycles were not numbered, thus other information is needed to identify specific years\.
.
.P
The Julian period or the Julian Day system provides astronomers with a single system of dates that could be used when working with different calendars to align different historical chronologies\. It assigns a Julian Day (JD) to every year without having to worry about B\.C\.E or C\.E\. It was invented by French Scholar Joseph Justus Scaliger in 1583, who proposed that the Julian Period starts at noon on January 1, 4713 B\.C\.E\. (Julian calendar) and lasts for 7980 years\.
.
.P
The Modified Julian Day (MJD) is an abbreviated version of the old Julian Day (JD) dating method which has been in use for centuries by astronomers, geophysicists, chronologers, and others who needed to have an unambiguous dating system based on continuing day counts\.
.
.P
The Japanese imperial year or "national calendar year" is a unique calendar system in Japan\. It is based on the legendary foundation of Japan by Emperor Jimmu in 660 BC and emphasizes the long history of Japan and the Imperial dynasty\.
.
.P
The Buddhist calendar: is a set of lunisolar calendars primarily used in mainland Southeast Asian countries of Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand as well as in Sri Lanka for religious and/or official occasions\. In Thailand, the name Buddhist Era is a year numbering system shared by the traditional Thai lunisolar calendar and by the Thai solar calendar\.
.
.P
Epact: If a solar and lunar year start on the same day, then after one year, the start of the solar year is 11 days after the start of the lunar year\. These excess days are epacts, and are added to the day of the solar year to determine the day of the lunar year\.
.
.P
Ides: a day in the Roman calendar that marked the approximate middle of the month\.
.
.SS "Uposatha"
The Uposatha (Sanskrit: Upavasatha) is a Buddhist day of observance, in existence from the Buddha\'s time (500 BCE), and still being kept today in Buddhist countries\. The Buddha taught that the Uposatha day is for "the cleansing of the defiled mind", resulting in inner calm and joy\. On this day, lay disciples and monks intensify their practice, deepen their knowledge and express communal commitment through millennia\-old acts of lay\-monastic reciprocity\. On these days, the lay followers make a conscious effort to keep the Five Precepts or (as the tradition suggests) the Eight Precepts\. It is a day for practicing the Buddha\'s teachings and meditation\.

There are five \'special\' full moon Uposatha:

.SS "Hanke\-Henry Permanent Calendar"
One of many examples of leap week calendars, calendars which maintain synchronization with the solar year by intercalating entire weeks rather than single days\. By reducing common years to 364 days (52 weeks), and adding an extra week every five or six years, the Hanke\-Henry Permanent Calendar eliminates weekday drift and synchronizes the calendar year with the seasonal change as the Earth circles the Sun\. As part of the calendar proposal, time zones would be eliminated and replaced with UTC\.
.
.SS "Discordian Calendar"
The Discordian or Erisian calendar is an alternative calendar used by some adherents of Discordianism\. The Discordian year 1 YOLD is 1166 BC\. As described in the \fIPrincipia Discordia\fR, the Discordian calendar has five 73\-day seasons: Chaos, Discord, Confusion, Bureaucracy, and The Aftermath\. The Discordian year is aligned with the Gregorian calendar and begins on January 1\.
